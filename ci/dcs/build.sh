# Build the ns-3 backend for the DCS cluster, once per workflow run, on a
# GitHub-hosted runner. The fleet no longer compiles: every SLURM job
# downloads the bundle this script produces, so a 16-job wave pays for one
# build instead of sixteen cold toolchains (each of which used to download
# ~1 GB of conda packages and extract ~100k files onto its scratch).
#
# The toolchain is the same rootless conda stack the cluster builds used:
# compiler, protoc, boost, MPI, zlib, and zstd all come from a fresh env
# under this job's own temp dir, nothing from the system but glibc - so
# the binary's platform floor (conda's sysroot) is unchanged from the
# days the cluster compiled for itself.
#
# One build per instruction-set level in MARCH_LEVELS: the compile node is
# no longer the run node, so -march=native is gone. x86-64-v3 is the
# fleet floor (AMD_Epyc7453 is Zen 3); x86-64-v4 covers the AVX-512 nodes
# (EPYC_9634, AMD_Epyc9754, XeonGold-6348). Each bundle carries the ns-3
# build tree plus the declared runtime env (ci/dcs/runtime-packages.txt),
# and is published only after its library closure resolves against the
# bundle alone - the build env is deleted before that check, so a
# dependency that silently leaked from the toolchain fails here, minutes
# in, not on the cluster, days in.
