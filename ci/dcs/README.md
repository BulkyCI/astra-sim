# DCS cluster runners for heavy evaluations

One just-in-time (JIT) GitHub Actions runner per experiment, scheduled by
SLURM, alive only while the experiment runs. No root, no docker, no PAT on
the cluster, nothing from the system but glibc.

## How it works

Every paired comparison in the evaluation matrix runs on the cluster
(structural experiments stay GitHub-hosted); the reusable workflow runs two
jobs per comparison:

1. `provision` (GitHub-hosted, ~1 min) mints a single-job JIT runner config
   with a one-hour GitHub App installation token, then pipes it over SSH to
   the cluster. The SSH key is bound to a forced command
   (`accept-runner.sh`) that can only submit one SLURM runner job — a
   leaked key gets no shell. The runner is labeled with the run id, so
   concurrent experiments can never swap runners.
2. `Cluster comparison` waits for that runner, downloads the run's
   prebuilt runtime bundle, and runs the whole three-arm comparison as
   one job (self-hosted jobs may run 5 days). The fleet never compiles:
   the `cluster-build` job in the main workflow builds ns-3 once per run
   with the rootless conda toolchain - one bundle per instruction-set
   level (`x86-64-v3` fleet floor, `x86-64-v4` for the AVX-512 nodes) -
   and each node selects its level from `/proc/cpuinfo`. Bundles travel
   as run artifacts and are archived permanently on the run's release.

Job scratch lives in the cluster's sanctioned network scratch — the newest
`/scratch/scratch-space/expires-<date>` directory, whose expiry always
exceeds the job walltime — never in quota'd NFS home, the small `/var/tmp`
partition, or RAM-billed tmpfs `/tmp` (each of which has caused a distinct
fleet failure; the sbatch script probes them only as fallbacks).

The JIT runner deregisters itself and exits when its one job ends —
completed, failed, or cancelled — which ends the SLURM job and returns the
allocation. A 30-minute idle guard in `runner-job.sbatch` covers the
cancelled-while-queued case; `#SBATCH --time` is the absolute backstop.
Write-scoped jobs (`archive`, ledger) stay on GitHub-hosted runners: the
cluster only ever holds a `contents: read` token.

`accept-runner.sh` fast-forwards the repository clone and submits the
repo's own `runner-job.sbatch`, so a push deploys cluster-side changes on
the next provision. Jobs are self-contained: each downloads its pinned
runner onto job-local scratch, and the home directory stays control-plane
only (checkout, forced-command script, jitconfigs, logs - under 1 GB).

The multi-gigabyte runtime extraction is shared, not duplicated: before
the wave provisions, a single seed job (`cluster-seed` in the main
workflow) publishes both ISA bundles as sealed read-only entries under
`<scratch base>/astra-sim/store/<artifact name>/` (`ci/dcs/seed-store.sh`),
and every evaluation job links against the entry its CPU supports
(`resolve-runtime.sh` + `install-runtime.sh`), cutting a wave's
environment footprint from ~33 private copies to one per ISA level. The
store is lockless by construction: the DAG runs the only writer before
any reader exists, an entry is published by one atomic rename (its
existence is the proof of completeness), entries are immutable
afterwards, and reaping is a pure age sweep (> walltime + slack) in the
next run's seed. Sharing is an optimization layer only - on any miss
(no network scratch, expired base, failed seed) a job downloads its own
bundle and extracts privately, exactly the pre-store behavior. No toolchain ever lands on scratch: `buildenv-packages.txt`
and `runtime-packages.txt` are consumed by the hosted `cluster-build`
job (`ci/dcs/build.sh`), whose bundle ships the declared runtime env the
binary resolves against (`ci/dcs/install-runtime.sh` verifies this on
the node before the sims start). Only `accept-runner.sh` itself still
deploys through `setup.sh`.

## Cluster setup (once)

```sh
git clone --no-recurse-submodules <repo-url> ~/astra-sim && cd ~/astra-sim
bash ci/dcs/setup.sh          # control-plane scripts into ~/astra-ci
```

Generate a dedicated key pair (`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f astra-ci -N ''`)
and add the public half to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` exactly as `setup.sh`
prints — with the forced command and `restrict`.

## GitHub configuration (once)

First create an org-owned GitHub App (no webhook, Repository permissions →
Administration: Read and write) and install it on this repository only.

| Kind   | Name                  | Value |
|--------|-----------------------|-------|
| secret | `DCS_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | The app's .pem private key, file contents verbatim. |
| secret | `DCS_SSH_KEY`         | Private half of the dedicated key pair. |
| var    | `DCS_APP_ID`          | The app's Client ID (or numeric App ID). |
| var    | `DCS_SSH_DEST`        | e.g. `jfang@comps0.cs.toronto.edu` |
| var    | `DCS_SSH_HOST_KEY`    | One line from `ssh-keyscan -t ed25519 <host>` (pins the host, defeats MITM on the jitconfig hand-off). |

## Routing

Nothing to configure per entry: `comparison: true` in
`.github/workflows/evaluation-matrix.json` is what routes an experiment to
the cluster. Aggregations and the ledger are unaffected: the cluster job
uploads the same `<artifact_name>-<run id>` bundle the hosted single-job
path produced before the pivot.

## Verifying the lifecycle contract

The provision job logs the SLURM job id and `squeue` shows the runner job.
Cancelling an Actions job mid-run must end its SLURM job within a minute —
that is the lifecycle contract working; a runner whose job never arrives
tears itself down after the 30-minute idle guard.

## Scratch tenancy

A completed experiment leaves nothing on the shared scratch volume. All
jobs live under one `astra-sim/<slurm job id>` parent per scratch base, so
a full wave presents as a single directory. Three mechanisms compose: the
mid-run segment hasher (`.github/scripts/segment_hasher.py`) folds each
sealed raw-log segment's uncompressed content into the arm's stream
digest and deletes it as the sim runs — nothing raw is ever uploaded; the
attestation carries the hashes, and results reach GitHub through the
scratch outbox (`ci/dcs/outbox.sh`) collected by a freshly tokened
courier job, because runner tokens stop refreshing after 24 hours; the
job's EXIT trap removes its own tree
(and the shared parent, when it is the last job out) whenever the job ends
for any reason that lets bash run; and every new job reaps orphaned
sibling trees whose SLURM job id no longer exists — the backstop for node
crashes and kills that outrun the trap. The non-numeric `store` and
`outbox` siblings are exempt from the reaper by construction; orphaned
outboxes die with their scratch generation. Only the control-plane files under
`~/astra-ci` (job logs, jitconfig staging) live outside scratch, and
teardown below removes those.

## Teardown

Remove the `authorized_keys` line, delete the two GitHub secrets, and
`rm -rf ~/astra-ci`. There are no services, cron entries, or standing
registrations to clean up; JIT runners deregister themselves.
