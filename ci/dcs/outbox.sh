# Lockless outbox between a multi-day evaluation arm and its minutes-old
# courier job. No GitHub-bound upload can be trusted from a job older than
# 24 hours (the runner's tokens stop refreshing), so the arm performs zero
# GitHub effects: it renames its results onto network scratch here, and a
# freshly provisioned courier job - sequenced after the arm by the
# workflow's `needs:` DAG, so single writer then single reader, no locks -
# collects and uploads them with a token that is minutes old.
#

#                                       raw *.zst segments are excluded (the
#                                       hasher owns them; anything left is
#                                       forensic residue, not results)
#   locate  <group> <key>               print the outbox path, exit 1 if none
#   discard <group> <key>               remove a collected outbox
#
# `place` resolves the newest expires-* scratch generation AT PLACEMENT
# TIME, not at job start: the cluster guarantees only that the newest
# generation expires more than five days out *now*, and an arm places its
# outbox up to 4d20h after its job started - trusting the generation the
# sbatch resolved at launch would leave the courier as little as four
# hours before the admins wipe it. Re-resolving restores a >=5-day
# collection window, which is what makes "re-run the failed courier" a
# real recovery rather than a race. ASTRA_OUTBOX_ROOT (exported by
# runner-job.sbatch) is only the fallback when the glob turns up nothing;
# with no network scratch at all, placing fails loudly, because the
# courier could never see a job-local path anyway. `locate`/`discard`
# glob every generation, so a rollover between the arm and its courier
# cannot hide the outbox. Orphans (arm died before courier, courier
# never ran) are wiped with the scratch generation itself when it
# expires.
